#Striver
**add heroku link**

##Minimum Viable Product
Striverr is a domain that allows users to post gigs (voice overs, web design, etc.) along with their qualifications. Other users can then browse these gigs in order to discover the service they need. The idea was inspired by www.fiverr.com. By the end of week 9, this app will, at minimum, satisfy the following critera with smooth, bug- free navigation, adequate seed data, and sufficient CSS styling:

*Hosting on Heroku
*New account creation, login, and guest/demo login
*Production README
*Post gigs
*Search bar
*Gig dashboard
  *orders, gig views, profile views, and listed gigs
*Tagging with categories
  *Nav bar with search by tag
*Rate and review
